      <h2>Our Story 💞</h2>
      <p>
        I still remember the moment our paths first crossed.  
It didn’t feel ordinary… it felt like the universe  
quietly whispering that something magical was about to begin.  
<br><br>
After months of chatting on Instagram and Snapchat,  
we finally decided to meet in Koti.  
I reached the bus stop after my coaching,  
but you weren’t there… I called, and that was the first time  
you heard my voice 😳  
<br><br>
You came, and we traveled together to LB Nagar on the bus…  
You dropped me home, and then came the most adventurous part -  
my mom caught me saying goodbye to you in front of my house!  
She was like, “Who is he? Why is he walking with you?!” 😂  
<br><br>
From that day, we slowly became best friends…  
two years of laughter, late-night talks, and little memories.  
<br><br>
Then, on 26-12-2024, you came to my college.  
We roamed around, and when it was time for you to leave,  
you asked for a hug and then said something I never expected -  
you asked me for marriage 💖<br>
I was stunned, so I said, “No, let’s stay friends like this.”  
<br><br>
But on 25-1-2025, I finally accepted you…<br>    
That day changed everything, and now I'm your pretty Girlfriend 💋
